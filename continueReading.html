        <h3>Introduction to CodeVita</h3>
        <p>CodeVita is an international coding competition organized by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), aimed at discovering and nurturing young coding talent. Known for its challenging problems and competitive atmosphere, CodeVita has become one of the most anticipated programming contests globally. Here's a detailed guide to understanding CodeVita from start to finish.</p>
        <h3>1. The Genesis of CodeVita </h3>
        <p>Launched in 2012, CodeVita began as a platform to identify talented software developers and provide them with an opportunity to showcase their coding skills. The contest is open to students and professionals worldwide, offering a unique chance to solve complex problems and compete with peers globally.</p>
        <h3> The Registration Process</h3>
        <p>To participate in CodeVita, candidates must first register on the TCS CodeVita website. The registration typically opens in the early months of the year. Participants need to provide basic details like name, contact information, and educational background. The registration is free of charge and open to all students from undergraduate to postgraduate levels.</p>
        <h3>The Structure of the Competition</h3>
        <p>CodeVita is divided into several rounds, each designed to test different aspects of coding and problem-solving skills:

            Round 1: Prelims
            The preliminary round consists of a single online test with algorithmic and coding problems. Participants are given a fixed amount of time to solve as many problems as possible. The problems range from basic to advanced levels, designed to assess logical thinking and coding proficiency.
            
            Round 2: Regionals
            Top performers from the preliminary round advance to the regional round. This stage is also conducted online, but it may involve more complex problems and tighter time constraints. The top scorers from this round proceed to the next stage.
            
            Round 3: Finals
            The final round is an intense on-site competition held in various locations globally. Finalists are invited to TCS offices or designated centers where they solve challenging problems under timed conditions. This round tests not only problem-solving skills but also the ability to work under pressure.</p>
